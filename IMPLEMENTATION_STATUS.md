Features:
- ✅ 30-day cache TTL for dimension analysis
- ✅ Tier-based access control (Free: Health only, Premium: all 5)
- ✅ Progressive response delivery (product info → dimension analysis)
- ✅ Cache invalidation on product updates and error reports
- ✅ Circuit breaker and retry logic for AI calls
- ✅ Performance monitoring with alerts
- ✅ Metrics logging and aggregation
- ✅ SmartBadge UI component with score-based color coding

### Nutritional Health Analysis System
Specialized nutrition label scanning with OCR and health scoring:
- **Image Classification**: Automatic detection of nutrition labels vs product images
- **OCR Extraction**: Gemini Vision-powered text extraction from nutrition facts
- **Ingredient Parsing**: Tokenization with allergen and additive detection
- **Health Scoring**: 0-100 score based on nutritional content and ingredients
- **Smart UI**: Expandable sections for score breakdown, nutrition facts, and ingredients

Features:
- ✅ Cache-first workflow with 30-day TTL
- ✅ Parallel parsing (nutrition + ingredients)
- ✅ Allergen detection (8 major allergens)
- ✅ Additive detection (preservatives, sweeteners, colors)
- ✅ Nutritional data validation
- ✅ Progress tracking with simulated updates
- ✅ Supabase integration for product storage
- ✅ MongoDB caching by image hash
- ✅ Accessible UI components (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## 🎯 System Architecture

### Product Identification Flow
1. Barcode scan → Tier 1 cache/database lookup
2. If miss → Tier 2 OCR text extraction
3. If miss → Tier 3 discovery search (optional)
4. If miss → Tier 4 comprehensive AI analysis
5. Store result in cache and database

### Dimension Analysis Flow
1. Product identified → Check dimension cache
2. If cache hit (< 30 days) → Return cached analysis
3. If cache miss → Perform fresh AI analysis
4. Apply tier-based filtering (free vs premium)
5. Store full analysis in cache (regardless of tier)
6. Return filtered results to user

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Test with Seeded Product
```bash
# Seed test product
npx tsx scripts/seed-test-product.ts

# Scan barcode 0044000034207
# Should succeed at Tier 1 in ~500ms
```

### Test Dimension Analysis
```bash
# Set user tier in .env.local
DEV_USER_TIER=premium  # or 'free'

# Scan any product
# Dimension analysis will run automatically
```

### Test Pages
- Production scan: http://localhost:3000/scan
- Multi-tier test: http://localhost:3000/test-multi-tier

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Gemini API Rate Limits
Google Tier 1 paid accounts may be throttled at free-tier limits (15 RPM). 

**Workaround**: 10-second delay between Tier 2 and Tier 4 to stay within limits.

**Solutions**:
1. Contact Google Support to fix rate limits
2. Switch to Vertex AI API
3. Use seeded test products to avoid API calls

## 🔧 Recent Fixes

### Product Duplicate Detection (2026-02-27)
**Issue**: When scanning a product image without a barcode, the system would create duplicate products instead of matching existing ones.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Improved `search_products_by_metadata` function with better fuzzy matching
2. Added bidirectional name matching (product name contains search OR search contains product name)
3. Better handling of NULL brand and size values
4. Added minimum similarity threshold (0.6 / 60%) for product matching
5. Enhanced logging to show similarity scores

**To Apply**: Run `./scripts/apply-product-search-fix.sh` or `supabase db push`

**Result**: Scanning the same product multiple times will now correctly reuse existing product data and dimension analysis.

## 🎉 System Status

Both the multi-tier product identification and integrated dimension analysis systems are fully operational and production-ready.
